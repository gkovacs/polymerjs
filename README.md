# polymerjs [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
> The Polymer library in a nice, frequently updated NPM package.

## Usage

Install `polymerjs` as a dependency:

```shell
npm install polymerjs
```

Polymer comes in three standard sizes.

#### full
[See features here](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/experimental.html#polymer-standard)
(311kb)

#### mini
[See features here](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/experimental.html#polymer-mini)
(114kb)

#### micro
[See features here](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/experimental.html#polymer-micro)
(27kb)

To use it, import it either as a dependency from your code:


```shell
import "polymerjs"
```

Note that Polymer will bind to the window object. If you please, you can also do:

```shell
import Polymer from "polymerjs"
```

Which is arguably more readable.

If you want to load the mini or micro versions, use:


```shell
import Polymer from "polymerjs/mini"
```

or 

```shell
import Polymer from "polymerjs/micro"
```

That's it!
